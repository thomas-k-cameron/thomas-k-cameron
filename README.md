### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a random software engineer on the internet.

## My Open Source Contribution
### Small Stuff
- [Example for converting dataframe to Rust Datatype on Apache Datafusion](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/pull/2969)
- [Bug Fix: Function is not converting data into enum Action properly #15](https://github.com/databento/dbn/pull/15)
### Large Impact
- [Serde Support for AWS SDK for Rust](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy-rs/blob/main/design/src/rfcs/rfc0030_serialization_and_deserialization.md)

  This is an ambitious project that adds serde support for official AWS SDK for rust!

## Personal Project
### Analysis of Market Activities on Osaka Exchange with snapshot of ITCH protocol messages
https://thomas-k-cameron.github.io/my-mbo-analysis-book/

I analyzed Osaka Exchange by using ITCH messages distributed during March 2021 with a dataset that consisted of over 45 billion records. 

## Work In Progress
### Generic order book simulator that works with data from different venues
https://github.com/thomas-k-cameron/tom_orderbook

I've built one that works with Moscow exchange and Osaka Exchange in the past, so I'm trying to make something that works with every data format.

### Hakcer Detection
I'm trying to build an algorithm that detects hackers on CSGO.   
This is going to take some time and rpeo is currently private.
